# Capstone-Project, Stage 1
Project 7 of the Android Nanodegree course byUdacity. In the Capstone project, you will build an app of your own design in two stages. In Stage 1, you will design and plan the app, using a template that we provide in the "Instructions" node.

###Why this Project?
To become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how you will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality to include in the app.
